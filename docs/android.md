# Terminology

Java is a compiled programming language. Developers write Java Source code. The
source code is compiled into "Java Bytecode" which can then be run inside of a
JRE.

The JRE is a "Java Runtime Environment". A JRE is needed to run compiled Java
code.

The JDK or Java SDK is the "Java Software Development Kit". The JDK contains the
tools and code needed to compile java code so that it can be run on a JRE.

The Android Operating System is build on top of Linux. The Android Operating
System is an Operating system just like Windows, or Mac OSX, iOS.

A new version of the Android Operating System is released every few months.  The
most current version is Android 9.0 (Pie). The last version was Android 8.1
(Oreo).

The Android SDK is the "Android Software Development Kit". It contains all the
tools and code needed to compile and build Android Applications.

APK is a Android package file. This is a file that you can use to install an

ontop of Intellij.
