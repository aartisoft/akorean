          <p>Hello, I'm Danny who is teaching Korean on 'italki'.</br>
          <a href="https://www.italki.com/teacher/4251641?ref=4251641x">"<u>Danny on italki"</u></a></br>
          I started teaching Korean on online from 2017.</br>
          And I could meet tons of students in the world.</p>
          <p>Some of my students were really good at learning language.</br>
          And finally, I could figure out how they could learn language quickly.</br>
          They were trying to keep learning everyday even it's really short time.</br>
          To do this effectively, most of them were using app.</br>
          Because we always keep our smart phone to be placed near us.</br>
          That's why I decided to make 'Awesome Korean'.</p>
          <p>But I hadn't any background of making app.</br>
          I studied from the zero to learn computer's language to make app.</br>
          And my students from all over the world helped me a lot.</br>
          Especially, 'Dave' from America is still giving me really precious technical support for me.</br>
          Starting this first app, I'll make several apps more with special topics.</br>
          Please enjoy this app and look forward to meet next one.</br>
          And I hope you could improve your Korean skills well with Awesome Korean.</p>
          <h3>Thank you! 고맙습니다! :)</h3>
