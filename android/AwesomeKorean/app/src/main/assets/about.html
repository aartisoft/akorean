          <hr>
          <p>안녕하세요? I'm Danny who is teaching Korean on 'italki'.
          <a href="https://www.italki.com/teacher/4251641?ref=4251641x"><b><i>"Danny on italki"</i></b></a></br>
          I started teaching Korean on online from <b>2017</b>.</br>
          And I could meet tons of students in the world.</p>
          <p>Some of my students were really good at learning language.</br>
          And I could figure out how they could learn language so quickly.</br>
          <b>They have been trying to keep learning everyday even it's really short time.</b></br>
          To do this effectively, most of them are using mobile app because we always keep our smart phone to be placed near us.</br>
          And I realized that there are a lot of Korean apps which are inaccurate.</br>
          That's why I decided to make</br>
          <b>'Awesome Korean'</b>.</p>
          <p>But I hadn't any background of making app.</br>
          So I studied from the zero to learn computer's language to make 'Awesome Korean'.</br>
          And my students from all over the world helped me a lot.</br>
          Especially, 'Dave' from America is still giving me really precious technical support for me.</br>
          Starting this first app, I'll make several apps more with specific topics.</br>
          Please enjoy 'Awesome Korean' and look forward to meet next app.</br>
          And I hope you could improve your Korean skills well with Awesome Korean.</p>
          <b>Thank you! 고맙습니다! :)</b>
