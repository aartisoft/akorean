          <h2>Batchim</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>We call last consonant to 'Batchim'.</br>
          <b>It's the consonant that is placed in under part of Hangul.</b></p>
          <p>When I teach Korean I could find a lot of students who feel difficult in Batchim.</br>
          They usually studied Batchim as a sound like</br>
          'ㄱ' = [k], 'ㄴ' = [n]...</br>
          And they think the sound of consonant is changing when they are Batchim. </p>
          <p><b>I want to say the Batchim is not a sound but the movement of our articulator like mouth, tongue, throat etc...</b></br>
          And I can also say we already had finished learning Batchim when we learned consonants.</br>
          Isn't it cool? </p>
