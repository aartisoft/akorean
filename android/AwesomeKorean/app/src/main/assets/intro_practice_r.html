          <h2>Reading practice</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Let's read some casual sentences and repeat after me. </p>
          <p><b>For the learners who are not used to reading yet,</b> don't try to understand every meaning of sentences.</br>
          Just focus on listen and repeat to be familiar with Korean accent and pronunciation.</p>
          <p><b>For the learners who are in the level of intermediate or above,</b> try to pronounce like a native. And figure out what are differences when we read naturally.</br>
          If you have learned Korean by yourself in the book, you could feel difficult to understand in the real conversation even though you already know every of words and grammars in the sentences.</p>
          <p>That's why you should practice listen and repeat practice a lot.</p>
