# Call Center Example

Imagine you have a call center with 3 levels of employees:
receptionist, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must
be first allocated to a receptionist who is free. If the receptionist
can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a
manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the
call should be escalated to a director.

Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a
method `dispatchCall()` which assigns a call to the first available
employee


# csv files

Comma Separated Values

# Queue vs list
ArrayQueue = FIFO first in first out
ArrayList = LIFO last in first out

# Popular Databases

MySQL
Postgresql

These are both relational database systems

SQL = Standard Query Language

Example of sql : 

select * from employee;

# Type Cast

Forcing a change of object type

# Polymorphism

Same methods, but different implementation

# Concurrent

2 pieces of code trying to change the same thing at the same time

# Multiple Threads

Javascript only has 1 thread. In javascript we must use callbacks.

In Java we can use multiple threads.

Android uses multiple threads, one for each activity.


# SQL - Structured Query Language

DML (data manipulation language) - select, update, delete (add and remove data)
DDL (data definition language) - create, drop, alter (create tables, create users)
