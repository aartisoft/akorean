<h2>Learning tip</h2>
<hr>
  When you try to memorize verbs and adjectives, it's better to make your real sentences.</br>
</br><b>For example,</b></br>
"I <u>have</u> a Thai friend."</br>
"I'll <u>stay</u> in Thailand for 4 years."</br>
...</br>
I made these sentences in Thai when I first started learning Thai.
And it helps me to remember the words and grammar easily. It also gives me a chance to practice speaking about my real life.
