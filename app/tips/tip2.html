<h2>Learning tip</h2>
<hr>
  When you try to memorize verb/adjective, it's better to make your real sentences.</br>
</br><b>For example,</b></br>
"I <u>have</u> a Thai friend."</br>
"I'll <u>stay</u> in Thailand for 4 years."</br>
...</br>
When I learn Thai, I made these sentences in Thai with my real story.
It makes me to remember the word and grammar easily and also I could have a chance to speak a lot in Thailand.
