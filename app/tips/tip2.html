<h2>Learning tip</h2>
<hr>
  When you try to memorize verb/adjective, it's better to make your real sentences.</br>
</br><b>For example,</b></br>
"I have a Thai friend."</br>
"I'll stay in Thailand for 4 years."</br>
...</br>
I made these sentences in Thai, when I learning Thai.
And it makes me to remember the word, grammar easily and gives me a chance to practice speaking in my real life.
