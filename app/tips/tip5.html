<h2>Learning tip</h2>
<hr>
I highly recommend to make flash cards to momorize some vocabularies or sentences. You can make your flash cards with paper or some apps. Don't try to study with this so hard. Just try to repeat your flash cards when you have a spare time everyday. It doesn't matter if it is only 5 or 10 minuites. </br>
Personally I like to use an app called 'Anki'. And if you have a chance to record native's voice, you can add that audio on your flash cards. It would be the best way to get used to Korean.
