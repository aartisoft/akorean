          <h2>Consonants</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Korean only has 14 consonants and 5 double consonants.</p>
          <p>We can make the sound of each consonant by using articulators like the lips, tongue, mouth, throat and nose.</br>
          <b>That's why we should think about the correct position of each articulator.</b></br>
          This will make you pronounce Korean like a native Korean.</p>
          <p>Some of consonants could be similar to sounds in your language.</br>
          But some of the others could be difficult to pronounce exactly right because you have never made that sound in your life.</br>
          Your muscles in your mouth may not be strong enough to make that new sound yet.</p>
          <p><b>Fortunately, we can train our muscles with practice.</b> Let's warm up your mouth before we start.</p>
