          <p>Korean has 14 consonants and 5 double consonants only.</p>
          <p>We can make a sound of each consonants by using articulators like lips, tongue, mouth, throat and nose.</br>
          That's why we should think about correct position of each articulators.</br>
          That will makes you to pronounce Korean like native Korean.</p>
          <p>Some of cosonants would be similar with your language.</br>
          But some of others would be difficult to pronounce exactly.</br>
          Because you have never made that sound in your life.</br>
          So your muscles in your mouth are not strong enough to make that new sound.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, we can train our muscles with practice. And it won't take much time.</p>
