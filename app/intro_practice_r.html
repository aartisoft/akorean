          <h2>Reading practice</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Let's read some casual sentences and repeat after me. </p>
          <p><b>For the learners who are not used to reading yet,</b> don't try to understand the meaning of every sentence.</br>
          Just focus on listening and repeating to become familiar with the Korean accent and pronunciation.</p>
          <p><b>For the learners who are intermediate level or above,</b> try to pronounce them like a native, and figure out what are the differences when we read naturally.</br>
          If you have learned Korean by yourself with a book, you might find it difficult to understand real conversations even though you already know all of the words and grammar in the sentences.</p>
          <p>That's why you should practice listen and repeat a lot.</p>
