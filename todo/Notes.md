Maven is popular because it prefers "convention over configuration"

For example, every maven project has same directory structure "src/main/java"

"src/test/java" is the conventional place to put "unit tests"

By convention, maven has several "phases". Each phase is made of "goals". 

For example, the "compile" phase is made up of several goals.
