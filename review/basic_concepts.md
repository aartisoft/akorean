1. Name some examples of Computer hardware.
  - CPU, RAM, HDD, Graphic card, CD-ROM...
2. What kind of language does Computer Hardware understand?
  - Machine code. But it's too hard to understand for human. So, people made high level programming language.
3. What is binary code?

6. What is the difference between "compile" and "interpret"?
  - They are kind of high level programming language. When we use compiler languages, we should convert that code to machine code. But if we use interpreter languages, we can omit this step. Compiler language has one more step. But it's faster when it's running. Interpreter language is simple to run the code. But it's slower than compiler language.
7. Is Javascript a "compiled" language?
